# AWS Terraform Proof-of-Concept

This repository showcases a multi-day AWS infrastructure build using **Terraform**, completed entirely within the AWS Free Tier. Each milestone is isolated in its own folder, with fully documented Terraform code and supporting material.

The goal: prove real-world cloud architecture skills using infrastructure as code, version control, and public documentation — all while maintaining portability, clarity, and AWS best practices.
